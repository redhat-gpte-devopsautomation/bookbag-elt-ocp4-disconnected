== Appendicies

The following sections are *not required* to finish the lab and be prepared for the next lab.

=== Appendix 1: Automated Solving and Resetting

====

WARNING: THE FOLLOWING STEPS WILL ERASE ALL YOUR WORK

Use the steps here to either solve or reset this lab.

Solving the lab will both reset (delete) whatever you currently have deployed and then do a full UPI disconnected installation.
Resetting the lab will only reset and cleanup anything you currently have deployed so you can start fresh.

NOTE: Resetting the lab requires the file `$HOME/aws-upi/metadata.json` to be present.

. On your `bastion`, ensure you have the following:
* Your OpenShift pull secret added to the `$HOME/ocp_pullsecret.json` file.
You do not need the `merged_pullsecret.json` as the solver will create it for you.
* Your AWS credentials (`$HOME/.aws/credentials`) as supplied in the environment deploy email

. To solve the lab

----
+
.. Open a new terminal to view logs in: `/tmp/ansible_solving.log`
.. When installation is complete, access your cluster by loading in the `kube/config` file.
Simply execute `source ~/.bashrc`

. To *reset* the lab, and delete all your work, run the following command
